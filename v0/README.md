The directory `v0` implements the blind signature over [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1), based on *"[An Efficient Blind Signature Scheme Based on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem](http://www.isecure-journal.com/article_39171_47f9ec605dd3918c2793565ec21fcd7a.pdf)"* paper by by Morteza Nikooghadama & Ali Zakerolhosseini.

The implementation of *"[New Blind Signature Schemes Based on the (Elliptic Curve) Discrete Logarithm Problem](https://sci-hub.do/10.1109/ICCKE.2013.6682844)"* paper by Hamid Mala & Nafiseh Nezhadansari, can be found at the root directory of this repository: https://github.com/arnaucube/go-blindsecp256k1
